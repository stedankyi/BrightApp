# BrightApp
This is v0.1 of my Twitter Clone built with ASP.NET and with SignalR to stream realtime changes to tweet database changes to the frontend.

! The app in it's current state is very limited. There's no login page to begin with. But there is some code for authenticating users, some frontend work need to be done.

# Features
* Users can post tweets and view the tweets of other users they follow.
* Users can follow and unfollow other users.
* Users can like tweets.
* Users can view a list of their tweets and the tweets of other users.

# Getting Started
* Install the latest version of .NET on your machine.
* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Open the solution file in Visual Studio or another IDE of your choice.
* Build the solution.
* Run the application.

# Configuration
* Twitter Clone uses a SQL Server database to store user and tweet information. 
* By default, it is configured to use a local instance of SQL Server. If you want to use a different database provider or connection string, you can modify the appsettings.json file in the root directory of the project.
